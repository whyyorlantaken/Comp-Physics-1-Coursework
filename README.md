# Comp-Physics-1-Coursework

The content addresses physics problems that have to do with, mainly, (1D and 2D) data analysis, numerical calculus and Fourier analysis. All the problems were designed by prof. Wladimir, and we were given some days (normally, a week) to solve them individually and submit them. Additionally, I added all the graded material, which includes the closed-book tests.

Some minor changes have been made to the code in the notebooks after receiving grades and feedback.

I hope they can be useful.

Note: MAY accounts for my name.
