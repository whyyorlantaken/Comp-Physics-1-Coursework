# Comp-Physics-1-Coursework
Work done in the Computational Physics 1 course given by prof. Wladimir Banda-Barrag√°n from February to June of 2024 at Yachay Tech.

The content addresses physics problems that have to do with, mainly, (1D and 2D) data analysis, numerical calculus and Fourier analysis. All the problems were designed by prof. Wladimir, and we were given some days (normally, a week) to solve them individually and submit them. 

Some minor changes have been made to them after receiving grades and feedback.

I hope they can be useful.
